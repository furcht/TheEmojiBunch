# The Emoji Bunch

There really isn't much to this app but downloading emoji's by copying the emoji character to your clipboard or downloading a custom library in JSON format to be integrated in your app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
